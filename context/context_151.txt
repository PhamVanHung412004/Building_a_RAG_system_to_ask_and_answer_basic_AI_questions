Impact Factor: How Many People Read My Article?
Journal Impact Factor is the average number of times articles from a journal published in the past two
years have been cited in the JCR year.
Journal
Citation
Reports
(JCR) is an annual
publication by Clarivate.
This means that, on average, its papers
published
in
2015
and
2016
received
roughly 42 citations each in 2017. 2017
impact factors are reported in 2018; they
cannot be calculated until all of the 2017
publications have been processed by the
indexing agency.

Eigen Factor: How Many People Read this Journal?
Based on the number of times articles from the journal published in the past five years have been cited in the JCR year, but it also
considers which journals have contributed these citations so that highly cited journals will influence the network more than lesser
cited journals.
Measured by counting the total number of citations a journal receives over a five-year period. Measures the total number of
citations. Measure of how many people read a journal and think its contents are important.
Example: 
Let's consider two scientific journals: Journal A and Journal B.
•Journal A publishes high-quality research papers and is frequently cited by other prestigious journals.
•Journal B also publishes quality papers but is cited by a larger number of journals, including some with lower impact.
In this scenario, the Eigenfactor Score would likely be higher for Journal A. Even if Journal B has more total citations, the 
Eigenfactor takes into account the quality and importance of the journals that cite the articles. Therefore, a citation from a 
highly influential journal would contribute more to the Eigenfactor than a citation from a less influential one.

Article Influence Score:
Has all the features of the Eigenfactor Score, with an additional normalization to the number of published
papers. Hence it can be considered the average influence of a journal's articles over the first five years
after publication.
X = 5-year Journal Article Count divided by the 5-year Article Count from All Journals.
The mean Article Influence Score for each article is 1.00. A score greater than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has 
above-average influence. A score less than 1.00 indicates that each article in the journal has below-average influence.

Cites Score:
CiteScore is another metric for measuring journal impact in Scopus. The calculation of CiteScore for the
current year is based on the number of citations received by a journal in the latest 4 years (including the
calculation year),

The h-index is a metric that quantifies both the productivity and impact of a researcher's scholarly output.
Sort the spreadsheet in descending order by the number of
times each
publication is cited. Then start counting down until the article number is equal to
or not greater than the times cited.
The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given
author/journal has published at least h papers that have each been cited
at least h times

The first author should be that person who contributed most to the work, including writing of the manuscript.
The sequence of authors should be determined by the relative overall contributions to the manuscript.
It is common practice to have the senior author appear last, sometimes regardless of his or her contribution. The senior author, like all other
authors, should meet all criteria for authorship
