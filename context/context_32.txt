LangChain: A framework for developing applications 
powered by large language models (LLMs). LangChain 
simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle: 
Development, Productionization, Deployment.

•
Development: Build your applications using 
LangChain's open-source building blocks 
and components. Hit the ground running 
using third-party integrations and Templates.
•
Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, 
monitor and evaluate your chains, so that you can 
continuously optimize and deploy with 
confidence.
•
Deployment: Turn any chain into an API 
with LangServe.
