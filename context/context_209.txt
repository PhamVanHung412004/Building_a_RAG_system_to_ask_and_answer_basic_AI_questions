U-Netmer: U-Net meets Transformer for medical
image segmentation
Sheng He, Rina Bao, P. Ellen Grant, Yangming Ou
Abstract—The combination of the U-Net based deep learning
models and Transformer is a new trend for medical image
segmentation. U-Net can extract the detailed local semantic and
texture information and Transformer can learn the long-rang
dependencies among pixels in the input image. However, directly
adapting the Transformer for segmentation has “token-ﬂatten”
problem (ﬂattens the local patches into 1D tokens which losses
the interaction among pixels within local patches) and “scale-
sensitivity” problem (uses a ﬁxed scale to split the input image
into local patches). Compared to directly combining U-Net and
Transformer, we propose a new global-local fashion combination
of U-Net and Transformer, named U-Netmer, to solve the two
problems. The proposed U-Netmer splits an input image into local
patches. The global-context information among local patches is
learnt by the self-attention mechanism in Transformer and U-
Net segments each local patch instead of ﬂattening into tokens to
solve the ‘token-ﬂatten” problem. The U-Netmer can segment
the input image with different patch sizes with the identical
structure and the same parameter. Thus, the U-Netmer can be
trained with different patch sizes to solve the “scale-sensitivity”
problem. We conduct extensive experiments in 7 public datasets
on 7 organs (brain, heart, breast, lung, polyp, pancreas and
prostate) and 4 imaging modalities (MRI, CT, ultrasound, and
endoscopy) to show that the proposed U-Netmer can be generally
applied to improve accuracy of medical image segmentation.
These experimental results show that U-Netmer provides state-
of-the-art performance compared to baselines and other models.
In addition, the discrepancy among the outputs of U-Netmer
with different scales is linearly correlated to the segmentation
accuracy which can be considered as a conﬁdence score to rank
test images by difﬁculty without ground-truth. The code will be
available on GitHub.

I. INTRODUCTION
Medical image segmentation aims to use machine learning
models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Networks or CNNs for
short) to automatically segment the target regions (organs
or lesions) from the input medical images with different
modalities [1], [2], [3], [4]. One popular backbone of the
deep learning model for segmentation is U-Net [5], which is
a general CNN model with an encoder and decoder structure
(Fig. 1(a)). The encoder path decomposes the input image from
local to global deep features where the spatial size is gradually
reduced by using the max-pooling operation. As the layer

U-Netmer model on single scale (s = 2) explicitly splits the input image into
4 equal-size local patches and uses U-Net to segment each local patch and

input images can be split into patches with different scales s = 1, 2, 4, 8.
When s = 1, the input is the whole image and s = 2, 4, 8 means splitting

goes to deep, it extracts the high-level contextual information
by discarding the detailed information on each local pixel to
remove noise and irrelevant information [6]. To recover the lost
detailed spatial information, the decoder path hierarchically
fuses global features from the output of the encoder and local
features from the intermediate output of the encoder [5] for
computing the ﬁnal segmentation map. In summary, as shown
in Fig. 1(a), the U-Net model implicitly extracts features from
local information towards global contextual information and
fuses these features gradually for the ﬁnal segmentation output
which has the same spatial size as the input image.
Based on the basic structure of the U-Net, many variations
have been proposed [4], [7]. For example, U-Net++ [1] uses
multiple decoder paths on different scales to fuse the global
and local information. Inspired by the attention mechanism
which can perform feature recalibration in deep neural net-
works [8], an attention module has been introduced in U-
Net for medical image segmentation [2]. Inspired by the
success of vision transformer [9], there is a new trend to
integrate Transformer into U-Net to fuse information from
different scales or resources to boost the performance of the
U-Net [10], [11], [12]. For example, MedT [12] uses a two-

branch structure including a global branch to learn global
information by CNN-based neural networks and a local branch
to learn local information using Transformer. Trans U-Net [10]
applies the Transformer on the last layer of the encoder from
the U-Net to boost the encoder of the U-Net. UCTransNet [11]
uses the Transformer to fuse the intermediate features of U-
Net in different scales obtained after max-pooling operations.
Most models of combing the U-Net and Transformer follow
the same structure of U-Net and consider the Transformer as
a sub-module which can learn the long-range dependencies
on deep features with different sizes to boost the performance
of segmentation [7]. Few studies use the strategy of cutting
the input image into local patches (which is also known
as “patchiﬁcation” [13]) for medical image segmentation (as
shown in Fig. 1(c)) which which raises at least two issues
existed [12]: (1) “token-ﬂatten issue”: the vision Transformer
ﬂattens the local patches into 1D tokens, but the 1D function-
ality losses the interaction of the tokenized information on the
local patches [11] and (2) “scale-sensitivity issue”: the vision
Transformer usually uses a ﬁxed scale to split the input image
into patches and the performance of medical image segmenta-
tion is sensitive to the scale s when cutting the input image into
patches with different sizes (as shown in Fig. 1(c)). Fig. 1(d)
shows the percentage of different scales which achieve the
best performance on test images of 7 different datasets (the
description of datasets can be see in Section III-A and the
experiment is described in Section IV-A1). It shows that not
all test samples have the highest segmentation accuracy with
scale s = 1 and some test images achieve the best accuracy
with other scales s = 2, 3, 4. For example, on BraTS, 36.5% of
the test images have the best segmentation accuracy with scale
s = 1, and 23.0%, 20.3%, 20.3% of the test images achieve
the best accuracy with scale s = 2, 3, 4, respectively. Thus,
directly cutting the input image into patches with a ﬁxed scale
and feeding them into Transformer is not necessarily optimal
for segmentation.
In this paper, we propose a simple and efﬁcient neural
network to optimally combine the U-Net and Transformer
for segmentation, named U-Netmer. Similar to vision Trans-
former, it explicitly splits the input image into local patches
and uses Transformer to integrate local information among
these patches (shown in Fig. 1(b)). The “patchiﬁcation” can
provide many potential applications for segmentation inspired
by the successful application for classiﬁcation, such as infor-
mation fusion from different modalities [14], patch dropping
and reconstruction for self-supervised learning [15] and few-
shot learning for dense prediction [16].
To solve the “token-ﬂatten issue”, U-Netmer uses a back-
bone of a standard segmentation neural network (such as U-
Net) to perform the segmentation on local patches instead of
ﬂatten each patch into 1D tokens. A standard neural network
usually contains an encoder and a decoder (as shown in
Fig. 1(a)). The output deep feature of the encoder is reshaped
into 1D tokens and all tokens from the local patches segmented
from the input image are concatenated as a sequence of tokens
as the input of a standard Transformer [17] (as shown in
Fig. 1(b)). The Transformer uses a self-attention mechanism
to learn the global-contextual information among local patches
to enhance the segmentation for each local patch.
To solve the “scale-sensitivity issue”, an identical U-
Netmer with the same parameter is trained on local patches
segmented with different scales s = 1, 2, 4, 8. Thanks to the
ﬂexible structure of the U-Netmer, it can be used on arbitrary
patch sizes without any changes of the network structure (as
shown in Fig. 3). Multi-scale patches are designed to reduce
segmentation’s sensitivity to patches at single scale [13].
The main contributions of the work are summarized below:
• We propose U-Netmer which consists of a backbone to
extract deep features on local patches and a Transformer
block to learn global-context information among local
patches. The backbone can be any encoder and decoder
structure for segmenting on local patches and we have
evaluated three backbones of U-Net [5], Attention U-
Net [2] and U-Net++ [1], yielding three variations of
U-Netmer.
• U-Netmer is a ﬂexible model which can segment the
input image with different patch sizes with identical
structure and the same parameters. Jointly training the
U-Netmer with different patch sizes can solve the scale-
sensitivity problem. Such crafted design and astutely
devised training strategies of U-Netmer allow the net-
work to seamlessly imbibe and incorporate bountiful
multi-scale contextual knowledge in learning procedures.
Therefore, U-Netmer consistently provide better results
on 7 public datasets compared to baselines and state-of-
the-art models for segmentation.
• U-Netmer can also output the segmentation maps with
different scales and the discrepancy of these outputs is
linearly correlated to the segmentation accuracy, which
can be considered as a conﬁdence score indicating the
conﬁdence of the segmentation map and ranks the test
images by the difﬁculty.
II. METHOD
A. Basic structure of U-Netmer
Fig. 2 shows the framework of the U-Netmer (with single
scale s = 2 as an example). U-Netmer can be denoted
as Ms = (Ps, E, T , D), which consists of “patchiﬁcation”
Ps, encoder E, Transformer T , and decoder D, where s ∈
[1, 2, 4, 8] is the scale (see Fig. 1(c)). Given the input image x
with the size of h×w (h is height and w is width, 2D image as
an example), the segmentation output y can be computed by:
y = Ms(x) = D(T (E(Ps(x)))). Each operation is described
in the following sections.
1) Patchiﬁcation Ps: Patchiﬁcation cuts the input image
into (typically equal-sized and non-overlapping) patches which
is an important step in vision Transformer [9]. Let s be the
number of the patches on one side of the input image and the
output of the Ps is a set of s × s patches (for 2D input image
as an example): p = Ps(x). The size of each local patch is
h/s×w/s. Fig. 1(c) shows the examples of patchiﬁcation with
different scales s = 1, 2, 4, 8.
2) Encoder E: In vision Transformer [9], the ith patch
pi ∈p, i = 1, 2, ..., s × s is ﬂatten into 1D feature vector.
However, for medical image segmentation, the aim is to make

Fig. 2. Framework of the U-Netmer with an example of the scale s = 2, indicating 2 patches on each side. The input image is ﬁrst split into 4 local patches
and each local patch is encoded into tokens by an encoder. Tokens of all local patches are fed into Transformer for learning the global context among patches.
The global-context enhanced tokens are then decoded by a decoder with the integrated information from the encoder for output prediction on each local patch.
The weights on the encoder and decoder are shared among all local patches.
predictions on each pixel within local patches. Thus, we use
a segmentation backbone to convert the patches into deep
features instead of directly converting the patches into 1D
tokens. The aim of using segmentation backbone is to learn
the rich information among pixels within local patches for
the pixel-level prediction. Given the local patch pi ∈p, the
encoder outputs fi, τi = E(pi), where f is a set of intermediate
deep features while τi is the deep feature from the last layer
which contains the deep abstract and contextual information
of the input local patch. Any encoder block can be applied
here to extract the deep features f and τ, such as the encoder
part of the U-Net [5] and U-Net++ [1], which usually consists
of several convolutional layers, followed by Rectiﬁed Linear
Unit (ReLU), Batch Normalization and Max-pooling layers.
The size of τi is h/(2ns) × w/(2ns) where n is the number
of max-pooling layer in the encoder E. As shown in Fig. 2, the
encoder is shared for all local patches, which can be efﬁciently
computed in parallel.
3) Transformer T : Although it is efﬁcient to segment small
local patches p, the global-context information of the input
image is missed when splitting the image into local patches.
To solve this problem, Transformer [17] is used to learn the
global-context information among the local patches to enhance
the segmentation on each local patch and further improve
the accuracy of the ﬁnal segmentation. We ﬁrst reshape the
deep feature τi obtained from the encoder into a sequence
of h/(2ns) × w/(2ns). Note that the number of tokens does
not vary with the scale s. The tokens from all local patches
are concatenated as 1D sequences τ = [τ1, τ2, ..., τs×s] with
the number of s×s×h/(2ns)×w/(2ns) = (hw)/2n tokens,
indicating the number of tokens does not related to the scale s.
To keep the position information of local patches, a learnable
position embedding vector ν is added to tokens: τ = τ + ν,
which is fed into the standard Transformer block [17] with a
multi-head self-attention (MSA) ˆτl = MSA(ˆτl−1) + τl−1 and
a feed-forward network (MLP): ˆτl = MLP(ˆτl) + ˆτl where l
is the number of Transformer block and ˆτ0 = τ. The detailed
information on the multi-head self-attention (MSA) and feed-
forward networks (MLP) can be found in studies [17], [9].
The output of Transformer ˆτ = T (τ) contains the global-
context information among all local patches learned by the
self-attention mechanism.
4) Decoder D: Similar to the encoder E, the decoder
aims to fuse the intermediate feature fi and global-context
embedded feature ˆτi ∈ˆτ to segment each pixel on the local
patch pi. The output of the decoder D is the segmentation
result oi = D(ˆτi, fi). All the outputs of local patches are
stitched together as the ﬁnal segmentation map B of the input
image x. The detailed structure of the decoder D is related
to the encoder E, which also consists several convolutional
layers, followed by Rectiﬁed Linear Unit (ReLU), Batch
Normalization and Up-pooling layers. Any decoder block of
the typical segmentation neural networks can be applied, such
as the encoder part of the U-Net [5], attention U-Net [2], and
U-Net++ [1]. As shown in Fig. 2, the decoder is also shared
among all local patches which can be efﬁciently computed in
parallel.

Netmer (with the same structure and parameters) which can be trained and
tested with different scales s. Bs=i is the segmentation map on scale s = i
(where i ∈[1, 2, 4, 8]).
B. Variations of U-Netmer
As discussed before, the encoder E and decoder D can be
obtained from any segmentation backbone. In this paper, we
use encoders and decoders from three typical segmentation
neural networks: U-Net [5], attention U-Net [2], and U-
Net++ [1], yielding to the U-Netmer, attention U-Netmer, and
U-Netmer++, respectively. Any other Transformer can be used
as Transformer T block to learn the global-context information
among local patches. In this paper, we use the standard
Transformer block for simpliﬁcation and generalization.
C. Joint training U-Netmer with multiple scales
Segmentation accuracy is sensitive to patch scale s (as show
in Fig. 1(d)). To overcome this limitation, we train the U-
Netmer with different scale s. The reasons are that (1) the
encoder E and decoder D can compute the deep features on
any size of local patches (with a minimal size of 2n due to
the n number of max-pooling layers) and (2) the number of
tokens (hw)/2n in Transformer T does not rely on the scale s,
indicating that cutting the input image into local patches with
different scales s results in the same number of tokens. As
shown in Fig. 3, the same model can be trained with different
scales s = 1, 2, 4, 8 with no added change and cost. Thus,
the U-Netmer can learn the information across different patch
sizes to boost the segmentation accuracy with an identical
setup. The patch size (h/s×w/s) is small when the scale size
is large and we only consider the scale values s = 1, 2, 4, 8
for easy computation.
In the following sections, we use s = ⟨i|j|...⟩to denote the
U-Netmer which is trained on all local patches segmented
with multiple scales i, j and others where i < j and
i, j ∈[1, 2, 4, 8]. For example, U-Netmer++s=⟨1|2|4⟩is the U-
Netmer++ trained with all local patches split with scales of
s = 1, 2, 4 from the input image. U-Netmers=⟨2⟩means the
U-Netmer is only trained on local patches split with single
scale s = ⟨2⟩.
III. EXPERIMENTS
A. Datasets
To evaluate the accuracy of U-Netmer, we conduct exper-
iments on 7 publicly available datasets for medical image
segmentation. The datasets used in the experiments include
(1) ACDC is from the Automated Cardiac Diagnosis Chal-
lenge [18] with the purpose of cardiac MRI (CMR) assess-
ment. It consists of 150 cardiac magnetic resonance images
with 100 for training and the rest of 50 for testing. (2)
BraTS is from 2020 Multimodal Brain Tumor Segmentation
Challenge [19], [20], [21] with the purpose of segmenting
brain tumor (including the peritumoral edema and tumor core)
segmentation. 369 scans with four modalities (T1, T1GT,
T2, FLAIR) have been split into 295 (≈80%) for training
and 74 (≈20%) for testing. (3) BUID is from Ultrasound &
Breast Ultrasound Images Dataset [22] with the purpose of
breast cancer segmentation. There are 780 images which are
randomly split into training (80%) and testing (20%) samples.
(4) CIR [23] consists of 956 CT images on segmented lung
nodules from two public datasets which are randomly split
into training (80%) and testing (20%) samples. (5) Kvasir is
from Kvasir-Seg [24] which consists of 1000 polyp images
(800 for training and 200 for testing). (6) Pancreas [25],
[3] consists of 285 CT scans with the purpose of pancreatic
parenchyma and mass segmentation. The dataset is randomly
split into 228 (80%) scans for training and 57 (20%) scans for
testing. (7) Prostate is from a Multi-site Dataset [26] which
consists 116 prostate T2-weighted MRI from three different
sites. The dataset is separated into 80% and 20% for training
and testing. For 3D images, we extract 2D slices for training
which are stitched into 3D for evaluation. For CT scans, the
intensity values are truncated to the range of 5% and 95%
percentile to remove the irrelevant details [3]. All images are
normalized with zero mean and one standard deviation. Fig. 4
shows examples of images for the 7 datasets.
B. Neural network training
All models are trained with the PyTorch package, with the
Adam optimizer of an initial learning rate 0.0001 which is
decayed to half after every 20 epochs. We totally trained 100
epochs with a batch size of 16. The cross-entropy is used as
the loss function in the training and Dice score is used as the
evaluation metric in the testing. To evaluate the performance
of the model itself, no data augmentation or post-processing
is applied for all models. All segmentation models, including
U-Netmer and other state-of-the-art models, are trained with
the same dataset and same training conﬁguration for a fair
comparison.

and 4 imaging modalities (MRI, CT, Ultrasound, and endoscopy).
IV. RESULTS
In this section, we present the ablation studies of the U-
Netmer with the comparison to state-of-the-art models and its
potential application for ranking the test images by difﬁculty
without ground-truth.
A. Accuracy of U-Netmer
1) Transformer supplements U-Net: To evaluate the impor-
tance of Transformer T on U-Netmer with different encoders
and decoders, we train models of U-Netmers=⟨i⟩, attention U-
Netmers=⟨i⟩and U-Netmer++s=⟨i⟩with and without Trans-
former on local patches segmented from input image with a
single scale s = i. Without Transformer T , the U-Netmers=⟨i⟩,
attention U-Netmers=⟨i⟩and U-Netmer++s=⟨i⟩are similar
to original U-Net, attention U-Net, and U-Net++ which are
applied on local patches segmented from the input image with
scale s = i.
Fig. 5 shows the accuracy of these models on 7 datasets.
Several observations can be obtained: (1) Models trained with
Transformer T have a higher accuracy than models trained
without Transformer T , especially on local patches segmented
from scale i = 2, 4, 8. The results show that Transformer T
can learn the global-context information among these patches.
The results are consistent of three different backbones (U-Net,
attention U-Net and U-Net++) over 7 datasets. (2) Unlike the
visioan Transformer [9], splitting the input image into local
patches with a single scale does not improve the accuracy
for medical image segmentation on the 7 datasets and the
accuracy decreases when patch sizes decrease (the scale s
increases) for all models with and without Transformer T .
We also plot the percentage of the best performance of U-
Netmer with Transformer T
among different scales s on
test images (shown in Fig. 1(d)). Results show that most
test images achieve the highest accuracy on s = 1. For
example, 85.0%, 36.5%, 55.4%, 45.4%, 54.5%, 66.7%, and
75.0% of test samples achieve the best accuracy with scale
s = 1 on ACDC, BraTS, BUID, CIR, Kvasir, Pancreas, and
Prostate datasets, respectively, which are larger than other
scales s = 2, 4, 8. Thus, the average accuracy decreases when
the scale s increases in single-scale split of input images.
2) Joint training U-Netmer with multi-scales improves
the accuracy compared with single-scale split: This section
presents the results of the U-Netmers=⟨i|j|...⟩trained with
local patches segmented with multi-scales. If the U-Netmer
is trained only on the single scale s = ⟨1⟩, the structure of the
U-Netmer is the same to the Trans U-Net [10] with U-Net as
the backbone. Thus, U-Netmers=1 is the one baseline for com-
parison. The advantage of the U-Netmer is that it can be also
jointly trained with local patches segmented from multi-scales.
For example, U-Netmers=⟨1|2⟩indicates that the U-Netmer
is trained on all local patches segmented with both scales
s = 1 and scale s = 2. We train the three variations of U-
Netmers=⟨1⟩(baseline), U-Netmers=⟨1|2⟩, U-Netmers=⟨1|2|4⟩,
and U-Netmers=⟨1|2|4|8⟩. When applying the trained U-Netmer
with multi-scale patches, different segmentation outputs Bs=i
can also be obtained on the corresponding scale s = i (see
Fig. 3). We evaluate the accuracy of each output Bs=i and the
results are shown in Fig. 6. During testing, the accuracy of the
output Bs=i slightly decreases when scale s = i increases. For
three models of U-Netmers=⟨1|2⟩, U-Netmers=⟨1|2|4⟩and U-
Netmers=⟨1|2|4|8⟩, the best results is achieved by the output of
Bs=1 of U-Netmer jointly trained with multi-scale split, which
are reported in the following sections.
Fig. 7 shows the accuracy of Bs=1 obtained from U-
Netmer models trained with different number of scales:
U-Netmers=⟨1⟩, U-Netmers=⟨1|2⟩, U-Netmers=⟨1|2|4⟩and U-
Netmers=⟨1|2|4|8⟩. Three variations of the U-Netmer have
consistent accuracy on datasets ACDC, BraTS, Pancreas and
Prostate. For ACDC, the best accuracy is achieved by U-
Netmers=⟨1|2⟩and for BraTS, Pancreas and Prostate, the best
accuracy is obtained on U-Netmers=⟨1|2|4⟩. For Kvasir, U-
Netmers=⟨1|2|4⟩provides the best performance with U-Net as
the backbone while the highest accuracies are achieved by
attention U-Netmers=⟨1|2|4|8⟩and U-Netmer++s=⟨1|2|4|8⟩with
attention U-Net and U-Net++ as the backbone, respectively. A
similar trend is found on BUID and CIR where the best ac-
curacy is achieved on different scales for different backbones.
In general, the results on Fig. 7 show that training U-Netmer
with multi-scales with different backbones can improve the
performance on all 7 datasets, providing higher accuracies
than training the U-Netmers=⟨1⟩which is the baseline model.
Table I shows the accuracy of the U-Netmer with single-
scale split and multi-scale split. The results show that training
the U-Netmer with multi-scale split improves the accuracy.
Similar results have also found on attention U-Netmer and
U-Netmer++.
3) U-Netmer trained with multi-scales outperforms state-of-
the-art models: We ﬁrst compare three variations of U-Netmer
with their corresponding baselines: U-Net [5], Attention U-
Net [2], U-Net++ [1] and Trans U-Net [10]. Table II shows
the accuracy measured by Jaccard index, Dice coefﬁcient, pix-
elwise accuracy, sensitivity and and speciﬁcity on 7 datasets.
Results show that U-Netmer outperforms its baseline models
in most cases. We also conduct the comparison study between
the U-Netmer and other state-of-the-art models including
other pure U-Net based models (such as BiOnet [27], Con-
vUNeXt [28], ResUnet [29]) and U-Net with Transformer
models (such as UNext [30], UCTransNet [11], MedT [12]).

Fig. 5. Dice accuracy comparison of different variations of U-Netmer trained with a single scale s = ⟨i⟩with Transformer T (w/, orange lines) and without
Tranformer (w/o, green lines) on 7 datasets. The accuracy signiﬁcantly drops for models without Transformer when the scale s = i increases, indicating that
the global-context information learned by Transformer is important for segmentation,especially with a high scale s = ⟨i⟩.

CIR, and Kvasir datasets.
4) Deep features learned by U-Netmer have higher seg-
mentation ability than those from its counterpart (U-Net):
This section presents the segemtnation ability (SA) scores
of each layer of the U-Netmers=⟨1|2|4⟩and the original U-
Net computed by the ProtoSeg [6] which can compute the
binary segmentation map on deep features based on prototypes
of background and target regions. There are 18 layers in a
typical U-Net and the U-Netmer with U-Net as the backbone.
The ProtoSeg can also be applied on input image which is
considered as a speciﬁcal feature map [6]. Fig. 8 shows the SA
scores of U-Net and U-Netmer including input images (index
0), 18 deep features (index 1-19) and the ﬁnal segmentation
output (index 20). It can be seen from the ﬁgure that the seg-
mentation ability scores of the U-Netmer trained with different
patch sizes are higher than the corresponding SA scores of
the U-Net trained with the whole input image, especially on
ACDC, BUID, CIR, Kvasir, and Prostate datasets. The results
show that U-Netmer trained with multi-scales can improve the
segmentation ability on deep features as well as on the ﬁnal
output.
5) Discussion: Experimental results show that the vanilla
U-Net [5] provides a moderate accuracy based on small input
patches which contain limited information for separating the
target region and background. Applying a Transformer block
among the local patches segmented from the same input image
can signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy (see Fig. 5) because the
local patches can learn the global-context information by the
self-attention mechanism in Transformer [31]. This inspires
the design of the U-Netmer which can make a prediction based
on local patches with different patch sizes without changes
to the model structure and parameters. However, training the
U-Netmer with a single scale (a ﬁxed patch size) does not
improve the accuracy (see Fig. 5) due to the fact that seg-
mentation is sensitive to the scales. To solve this problem, we
train the U-Netmer with local patches segmented with multi-
scales which can improve the accuracies for segmentation. The
same results are also found on the three different variations
(see Fig. 7). The U-Netmer trained by patches with different
sizes (multi-scales) provides the highest accuracy compared
to four different baselines and other U-Net based and U-Net
combined with Transformer models (see Table III), indicating
that training neural networks with multiscale information can
improve the accuracy of segmentation. By computing the
segmentation ability scores [6] on layers of the U-Netmer,
we ﬁnd that the training U-Netmer with different patch sizes
can improve the segmentation ability on different layers and
further improve the ﬁnal segmentation. Overall, experimental
results have shown that U-Netmer trained with multi-scales
can improve the accuracy on the test 7 datasets with different
modalities.
B. U-Netmer can be used to rank test images by difﬁculty
without ground-truth
Ranking the test images by difﬁculty without ground-truth
can provide useful information for end users to automatically
identify the most challenging examples for human experts to
review [32], [6]. Most segmentation models only output the
segmentation result without such a “conﬁdence” evaluation.
This limits the use of segmentation algorithms in clinical
practice when certain acceptance criteria are required [33]
or when we need to prioritize users’ time on inspection and
auditing [32]. There is an unmet need to evaluate segmen-
tation accuracies and even to reject failed segmentations in
the real-world applications when the ground-truth is absent
in reality [34]. Most studies estimate the pixel/voxel level
uncertainty [32], [35], [36] to highlight the challenging regions

within the target region or background on the single input im-
age. These methods do not provide the image level conﬁdence
scores to automatically select a subset of challenging samples.
The U-Netmer can provide an estimation of the conﬁdence
score which can be used to rank the test image by difﬁculty
without ground-truth. Given a test image, U-Netmer can make
predictions with different scales. We use Bs=i to denote
the segmentation map computed with scale s = i. Fig. 9
shows testing examples of the segmentation maps from the
scale s = 1 (Bs=1) and s = 2 (Bs=2) of the trained
U-Netmers=⟨1|2|4⟩. One observation is that the segmentation
maps of Bs=1 and Bs=2 are similar on easy samples while
they are different on difﬁcult samples. Part of the reason is that
the target regions (e.g., lesions) on difﬁcult samples have low
contrast information compared to their background or have
a small size, yielding to different segmentation results with
different scales. Therefore, their discrepancy can be used to
measure the difﬁculty of the test images or rank the test images
by difﬁculty without ground-truth for segmentation.
To measure the difﬁculty of the test images without ground-
truth, we compute the discrepancy between the estimation of
Bs=i and Bs=j (where i ̸= j) by: Cij = D
 Bs=i, Bs=j

,
where D is a distance metric to measure the difference between
two estimated segmentation maps of Bs=i and Bs=j. C has a
different meanings given different distance metric D. If the
distance metric is deﬁned as D = |Bs=i −Bs=j|, the C
indicates the uncertainty regions of the segmentation map [37].
In this paper, we use the Dice coefﬁcient as the distance metric
to measure the difﬁculty to segment each image, deﬁned as:
Cij = 2|Bs=i ∩Bs=j|/|Bs=i + Bs=j| where Cij measures the
consistency between the segmentation maps between Bs=i and
Bs=j obtained from U-Netmer with different scales s = i and
s = j. Cij is considered as the conﬁdence score to estimate the
segmentation accuracy of the testing images without ground-

truth for end users.
Fig. 10 shows the Pearson correlation between the Dice
accuracy of the ﬁnal segmentation and the conﬁdence score Cij
obtained by U-Netmers=⟨1|2|4⟩. We also compare them with
the baseline of the mean SA score computed by ProtoSeg [6]
which is the mean segmentation ability score computed on
the last two layers of the neural network for ranking the test
images by difﬁculty. The results show that the Pearson corre-
lation between C and the segmentation accuracy is higher than
the one between ProtoSeg and the segmentation accuracy on
6 datasets except on ACDC dataset. In addition, C12 provides
the highest correlation on BraTS, CIR, Kvasir, Pancreas while
C14 provides the highest correlation on the BUID and Prostate
datasets.
To test whether the conﬁdence score obtained by U-Netmer
is discriminative between easy and difﬁcult test samples, we
plot the segmentation accuracy of test samples bucketed by
the decile of conﬁdence scores [32]. We ﬁrst rank all testing
samples based on the estimated conﬁdence score and the
testing samples within the d% percentile are included to com-
pute the accuracy of the segmentation. This is similar to the
coverage [38] which rejects the (100-d)% difﬁcult samples for
further attention. Fig. 11 shows the accuracy of segmentation
with different percentile d. We show that examples at the
highest percentiles on the rank often have high segmentation
accuracy and the scores computed by U-Netmer provide higher
accuracy than ProtoSeg [6] on 6 datasets except for Pancreas.
The results also demonstrate that the conﬁdence scores have a
high correlation with the segmentation accuracies on the test
images.
Fig. 12 visualizes test images and their corresponding
segmentation results ranked by the conﬁdence scores C on
the 7 datasets. Images with low conﬁdence scores tend to
have small target regions, smooth boundaries and poor contrast
between the target and background tissues. The accuracies
of their segmentation results are usually low. Images with
high conﬁdence scores often have large target regions and
clear boundaries, yielding more consistent segmentation maps
obtained from different scales of U-Netmer. For test images
without ground-truth, the conﬁdence score can be used by
end-users with a human-in-the-loop strategy: it can suggest
the segmentation results of these images with low conﬁdence
scores to the human users for further review.
V. CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we have presented the U-Netmer which is a
combination of CNN-based neural network and Transformer
for medical image segmentation. We have studied three vari-
ations of the U-Netmer where the backbones are from three
typical segmentation neural networks: U-Netmer, Attention U-
Netmer, and U-Netmer++. Experimental results on 7 datasets
for medical image segmentation with different modalities have
shown that the U-Netmer can provide competitive results
compared to four baselines and six state-of-the-art models. The
U-Nemter can also provide segmentation maps with different
scales on test images. The discrepancy of these segmentations
is linearly correlated to the segmentation accuracy, which can
be considered as a conﬁdence score to rank the test images by
difﬁculty when the ground-truth is absent. This is important in
real world applications, as it can highlight most difﬁcult cases,
or least accuracy cases, for users’ further inspection and edit.
