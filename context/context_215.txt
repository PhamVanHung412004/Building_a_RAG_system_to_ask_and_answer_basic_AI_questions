❖Introduction
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised-learning ML 
algorithm that works by identifying the optimal hyperplane 
that best separates data into different classes. 
SVM was originally built for classification task (SVC) but was 
later modified to fit for regression task (SVR) too.

How should we draw a line so that we can perfectly separate this dataset into 2 classes? 
5
Support Vector Machine
❖Getting Started
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
There are many ways to draw the line

Class -1
Class 1
With this line, we can now determine whether a new 
data point belongs to Class -1 or Class 1 based on which 
side of the line it falls on.
This point is classified 
as Class 1 since it lies 
on right hand side of 
the line.

❖Getting Started

(TA Session)
However, in this situation, the result seems wrong since 
the point is more closer to Class -1.
=> This line is not really optimal.
This point is classified 
as Class 1 since it lies 
on right hand side of 
the line.
What would be the best line?

Support Vector Machine
❖Getting Started
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
This line looks awful because 
the distances from points are 
pretty close.
This line looks better 
since the distances to 
nearest points are much 
longer.

Support Vector Machine
❖SVM idea
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
SVM idea: Find the line that best separates the data into 
classes while maximizing the distances between nearest 
points.
Maximizing these!
10
Support Vector Machine
❖Margin
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
The distance between the line and the nearest data point from 
either of the two classes is called Margin.
11
Support Vector Machine
❖Hard Margin SVM Idea
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
SVM idea: Find the line that best separates the data into 
classes while maximizing the margin. This is called Hard 
Margin SVM.

❖Hard Margin SVM Problem
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
However, assume we have an outlier
Using Hard Margin SVM, we might 
have a line like this.
Not a good classifier
13
Support Vector Machine
❖Soft Margin SVM
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
To avoid this, we should allow 
misclassifications.
Not a good classifier
How to avoid this case?
Misclassification

❖Soft Margin SVM
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
However, when we have a new data point, we 
might get it right.
New Data Point 
classified as Green
15
Support Vector Machine
❖Soft Margin SVM
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
When we allow misclassifications, the distance between the 
observations and the decision boundary is called Soft Margin 
=> Soft Margin SVM (Support Vector Classifier).
16
Support Vector Machine
❖Soft Margin SVM
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
To better have a sense of relation between data points and 
Soft Margin, we draw two parallel lines to the Decision 
Boundary on Support Vectors.
Class -1
Class 1
Misclassification

Support Vector Machine
❖Why “Support” Vector Machine
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
Support Vectors
We called “Support” Vector Classifier because the data 
points on the edge and within the Soft Margin are called 
Support Vectors.
