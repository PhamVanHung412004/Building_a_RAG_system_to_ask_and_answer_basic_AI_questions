“A wonderful little production. <br /><br />The filming technique is very unassuming- very old-time-
BBC fashion and gives a comforting, and sometimes discomforting, sense of realism to the entire 
piece…..”
positive
“This show was an amazing, fresh & innovative idea in the 70's when it first aired. The first 7 or 8 
years were brilliant, but things dropped off after that. By 1990, the show was not really funny anymore, 
and it's continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today….”
negative
“I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend, sitting in the air 
conditioned theater and watching a light-hearted comedy. The plot is simplistic, but the dialogue is 
witty and the characters are likable (even the well bread suspected serial killer)….”
positive
“BTW Carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes 
he's on screen.”
