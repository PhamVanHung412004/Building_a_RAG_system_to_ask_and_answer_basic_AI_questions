simplicity: simplify the object detection pipeline by removing the need for intermediate 
steps like proposal generation and NMS
end-to-end: predict the final set of objects (and their bounding boxes) in a single step
fully differentiable: can be entirely trained in a single pass of gradient descent, which 
usually comes with significant speed and simplicity

YOLOv3 uses a variant of Darknet, which originally has 53 layer network trained on
ImageNet. For the task of detection, 53 more layers are stacked onto it, giving us a 106 layer
fully convolutional underlying architecture for YOLOv3. The detections are made at three
layers 82nd, 94th and 106th layer.
