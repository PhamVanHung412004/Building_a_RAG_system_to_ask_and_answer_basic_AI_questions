• Cancer classification => Train Logistic Regression => You got 1% error 
on  the the test test => 99% accuracy.
• How about the case if only 0.5% of patient have cancer on the Test 
set.

KNN Review
1.Load the data
2.Initialize the value of k
3.For getting the predicted class, iterate from 1 to total number of training data points
4.Calculate the distance between test data and each row of training dataset. Distance
metrics: Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, Chebyshev,
cosine, Hamming Distance etc.
5.Sort the calculated distances in ascending order based on distance values
6.Get top k rows from the sorted array
7.Get the most frequent class of these rows
8.Return the predicted class
Which step might cause the problem? And Why?
54

In case of Odd k values, it takes the majority. For even k rows, majority classes are selected. If it happens to have two or 
more classes having majority. Those two or more major class distances will go to the distance metric loop again and 
check which class has the lowest distance metric and that class is chosen as the majority class.
