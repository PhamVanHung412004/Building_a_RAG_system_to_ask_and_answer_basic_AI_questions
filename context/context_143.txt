NCC is another window-based matching technique that is commonly used. NCC compensates for gain changes and is statistically the optimal 
method for dealing with Gaussian noise. However, NCC tends to blur depth discontinuities more than many other matching costs because 
outliers lead to high errors within the NCC calculation

Define Clear Objectives and Metrics 
Percentage of Bad Pixels: Measures the percentage of pixels with disparity errors exceeding a specified threshold. Common thresholds 
include 1, 2, or 3 pixels.
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Calculates the square root of the average squared disparity errors across all pixels. It provides a 
measure of the overall accuracy.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Computes the average absolute disparity errors. It is less sensitive to outliers than RMSE.
The "d1-bg" error is specifically defined as the percentage of disparity errors (in pixels) where the absolute disparity error is less than 1 
pixel and the error occurs in regions classified as foreground or background

What is Cross-Validation?
Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating a machine learning model and testing its performance. 
Cross-validation a powerful tool for selecting the best model for the specific task.
Common actions of cross-validation algorithms 
Divide the dataset into two parts: one
for training, other for testing
Step 1
Train the model on 
the training set
Step 2
‚Ä¢ Validate the model 
on the test set
Step 3
Repeat 1-3 steps a couple of 
times. This number depends on 
the CV method that you are 
using

Parameter Tuning
If your method has hyperparameters, perform a thorough parameter tuning process using techniques such as grid search or random search. This 
ensures that your model is optimized for performance.
A model hyperparameter is a characteristic of a model that is external to the model and whose value cannot be estimated from data. The value of 
the hyperparameter has to be set before the learning process begins. For example, c in Support Vector Machines, k in k-Nearest Neighbors, the 
number of hidden layers in Neural Networks.
‚Ä¢Random Search. Define a search space as a bounded domain of 
hyperparameter values and randomly sample points in that domain.
‚Ä¢Grid Search. Define a search space as a grid of hyperparameter values and 
evaluate every position in the grid.
More advanced methods are sometimes used, such as Bayesian Optimization and Evolutionary Optimization.
