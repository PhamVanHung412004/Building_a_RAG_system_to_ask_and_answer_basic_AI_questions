Image Gradient
An image gradient is defined as a directional change in image intensity
Vertical change
Horizontal change
The gradient magnitude is used to measure how strong the change in image intensity is
The gradient orientation is used to determine in which direction the change in intensity is pointing

Simple Approach
1. Estimate the background for time t. 
2. Subtract the estimated background from the input frame. 
3. Apply a threshold T to the absolute difference to get the foreground mask.
Prof. Birgi Tamersoy. The University of Texas at Austin
how can we estimate the background?

Depending on the object structure, speed, frame rate 
and global threshold, this approach may or may not

Advantages: 
– Extremely easy to implement and use! 
– All pretty fast. 
– Corresponding background models are not constant, they change over 
time
Disadvantages: 
– Accuracy of frame differencing depends on object speed and frame rate! 
– Mean and median background models have relatively high memory 
requirements.
– There is one global threshold, Th, for all pixels in the image

How Image Blurring Work
Blurring an image is make the image less sharp. This can be done by smoothing the
color transition between the pixels.
Mean Filter (Average Filter/Box Filter)
The greater value of kernel size, the greater _____ because the number of pixels
involved is greater and the transition of colors become smoother.

Vinh Dinh Nguyen- PhD in Computer Science
Line Detection Clearly Explain
Say we have 2 edge points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). For each edge point at various gradient values (m=-0.5, 1.0, 1.5, etc.), we calculate
the corresponding b values. The image below shows the various lines through an edge point in image space and the plot of these lines
in parameter space. Points which are collinear in the cartesian image space will intersect at a point in (m,b) parameter space.
All points on a line in image space intersect at a common point in parameter space. This common point (m, b) represents the line in image 
space.
Unfortunately, the slope, m, is undefined
when the line is vertical (division by 0!).
To overcome this, we use another
parameter space, the Hough space.
