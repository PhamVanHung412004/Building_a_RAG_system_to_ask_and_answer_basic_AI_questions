Abstract

❖Content
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) recently has been a new rising research hotspot, which 
uses powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as a brain to perform multimodal tasks. The surprising 
emergent capabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math reasoning, 
are rare in traditional methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. In this paper, 
we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLM. First of all, we present the formulation of 
MLLM and delineate its related concepts. Then, we discuss the key techniques and applications, 
including Multimodal Instruction Tuning (M-IT), Multimodal In-Context Learning (M-ICL), Multimodal Chain 
of Thought (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). Finally, we discuss existing challenges 
and point out promising research directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just begun, 
we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research. An associated GitHub link 
collecting the latest papers is available at https://github.com/BradyFU/Awesome- 
Multimodal-Large-Language-Models.

❖What is LLMs?
AI VIETNAM
Seminar
LLMs (Large Language Models): Are language models that were trained on a very large corpus of text. This 
made them capable of performing various NLP tasks with high precision.

❖Content
AI VIETNAM
Seminar
❖
Performed a survey of the existing M-LLMs literature.
❖
Main directions: M-IT, M-ICL, M-CoT and LAVR. 
❖
Applications: Knowledge-based VQA, OCR-Free eKYC…
❖
Limitation:
➢
Still limited in perception capabilities, leading to wrong visual information.
➢
The reasoning chain of MLLMs are still fragile in some cases.
➢
The instruction-following ability needs upgrading.
➢
The object hallucination issues.
➢
Parameter-efficient training is needed.
