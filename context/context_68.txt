Request
Response
API server
•
A client sends a request to API server. The request is made using a specific protocol (such as HTTP) and 
includes information about the operation the client wants to perform, e.g., retrieving data or updating a 
resource.
•
The API server receives the request and processes it. The API server sends a response back to the client, 
which may include data, an error message, or a status code indicating the result of the operation.
•
The client receives the response and processes it.

HTTP status codes are three-digit response codes or 
messages sent by a server to user at the other end of the 
server. These codes or responses enable servers to 
communicate with users on the internet.

with every request before it is processed 
by any specific path operation. And also 
with every response before returning it.
