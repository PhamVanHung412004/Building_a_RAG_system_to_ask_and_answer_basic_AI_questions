Region Proposal Algorithms
Region proposal algorithms identify prospective objects in an image using segmentation. In segmentation, we group adjacent regions which are 
similar to each other based on some criteria such as color, texture etc. 
Segmentation Result
RBG Image
Can we use segmented parts in this image as region proposals? The answer is no and there are two reasons why we cannot do that
1.Most of the actual objects in the original image contain 2 or more segmented parts
2.Region proposals for occluded objects such as the plate covered by the cup or the cup filled with coffee 
cannot be generated using this method

Selective Search
Selective search uses oversegments from Felzenszwalb and Huttenlocher’s method as an initial seed. An oversegmented image looks like this.
1.
Add all bounding boxes corresponding to segmented parts to the list of regional proposals
2.
Group adjacent segments based on similarity
3.
Go to step 1
Selective Search uses 4 similarity measures based on 
color, texture, size and shape compatibility.

1.It consumes a huge amount of time, storage, and 
computation power.
2.It has a complex multi-stage training pipeline(3 stage — 
Log loss, SVM, and BBox Regressor’s L2 loss).
Why not consider running the CNN just once per image and 
then find a way to share that computation across the ~2000 
proposals?

The idea of ROI projection is that we get the coordinates of the bounding box from the ROI proposal and we need to project them onto the

Overlapping ROIs
Anchor Boxes Solution
From the image, we see a lot of objects overlapping each other. We see a car, a bicycle, a person holding 
a television, and a dog inside this television. The selective search could solve this problem but we end up 
with a huge number of ROIs. We need to think of an idea that efficiently solves this.

Anchor Boxes
Any object in the image can be detected using boxes of 
3 different scales and 3 different aspect ratios.
This could be a technique that can be used to solve our 
purpose of replacing the region proposer.

Another option is to use sliding windows of different sizes (9, as shown above) on the Feature Map. This concept 
is called the Feature Pyramid. This involves the use of sliding windows of 9 different sizes on top of the feature

The pizza came out of the oven and it tasted good!
Seft-attention works by seeing how similar each word is to all of the words in the sentense, including itself
The pizza came out of the oven and it tasted good!

An Image is Worth 16*16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale," 
published at ICLR 2021.
1.Split an image into patches
2.Flatten the patches
3.Produce lower-dimensional linear embeddings from the flattened patches
4.Add positional embeddings
5.Feed the sequence as an input to a standard transformer encoder
6.Pretrain the model with image labels (fully supervised on a huge dataset)
7.Finetune on the downstream dataset for image classification
The ViT model represents an input image as a series of image patches, like the series of word 
embeddings used when using transformers to text, and directly predicts class labels for the image.
