❖Introduction
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
Support Vector Machine (SVM): A supervised-learning ML 
algorithm that works by identifying the optimal hyperplane 
that best separates data into different classes. 
SVM was originally built for classification task (SVC) but was 
later modified to fit for regression task (SVR) too.

Linearly separable data: A dataset that can 
be fully separated into classes using a single 
line.

Class 0
Class 1
With this line, we can now determine whether a new 
data point belongs to Class 0 or Class 1 based on which 
side of the line it falls on.
This point is classified 
as Class 1 since it lies 
on right hand side of 
the line.

However, in this situation, the result seems wrong since 
the point is more closer to Class 0.
=> This line is not really optimal.
This point is classified 
as Class 1 since it lies 
on right hand side of 
the line.
What would be the best line?

This line looks awful because 
the distances from points are 
pretty close.
This line looks better 
since the distances to 
nearest points are much 
longer.

while maximizing the distances between nearest points.
Maximizing these!

might have a line like this.

❖Soft Margin Classifier

misclassification

might get it right.

❖Soft Margin Classifier
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
When we allow misclassifications, the distance between the 
observations and the decision boundary is called Soft Margin 
=> Soft Margin Classifier (Support Vector Classifier).
23
Support Vector Machine
❖Why “Support” Vector Classifier
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
Support Vectors
We called “Support” Vector Classifier because the data 
points on the edge and within the Soft Margin are called 
Support Vectors.
24

❖Why “Support” Vector Classifier
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
To better have a sense of relation between data points and 
Soft Margin, we draw two parallel lines to the Decision 
Boundary on Support Vectors.

Classifying a data point using the 
hyperplane.
In this example, we use X1 and X2 to predict Y.
With w = (1, -1) and b = -3, the equation of 
hyperplane becomes:
