Mean Shift Motivation
The mean-shift algorithm is an efficient approach to tracking objects whose appearance is defined by histograms 
Motivation – to track non-rigid 
objects, (like a walking person), 
it is hard to specify
an 
explicit 
2D 
parametric 
motion model.
Appearances
of
non-rigid
objects
can
sometimes
be
modeled
with
color
distributions

Mean Shift Vector
• Given: data points and approximate location of the mean of this data
• Task: Estimate the exact location of the mean of the data by determining the shift vector from the initial mean.
• Properties of mean shift : 
•
Always point towards the direction of the maximum increase in the density
•
Mean shift vector has the direction of the gradient of the density estimate

Kernel Density Estimation
On every data point xi, we place a kernel function K
Kernel Density Estimate:
Kernel is simply a function which satisfies following three properties as mentioned below :
•
K(x) ≥0 for every x
•
Symmetric: K(x) = K(-x) for every x
•
Decreasing: K’(x) ≤ 0 for every x > 0
•
Area under the curve of the function must be equal to one

KDE: Example
We have grade obtained by six students in a Computer Vision class. 
We are going to construct kernel at each data point using Gaussian kernel function
Xi = {65, 75, 67, 79, 81, 91}
Three inputs are required to develop a kernel curve around a data point:
•
The observation data point which is Xi
•
The value of h
•
A linearly spaced series of data points which houses the observed data points 
where K values are estimated.
Xj = {50,51,52 …. 99}
Calculation of K values for all values of Xj for a given 
values of Xi and h is shown in the table below: 
where Xi = 65 and h = 5.5

Mean Shift Mode Detection
Updated Mean Shift Procedure:
• Find all modes using the Simple Mean Shift Procedure
• Prune modes by perturbing them (find saddle points and plateaus)
• Prune nearby – take highest mode in the window
What happens if we
reach a saddle point 
?
Perturb the mode position
and check if we return back

• Automatic convergence speed – the mean shift  
vector size depends on the gradient itself.
• Near maxima, the steps are small and refined
• Convergence is guaranteed for infinitesimal  
steps only è infinitely convergent, 
(therefore set a lower bound)
• For Uniform Kernel (      ), convergence is achieved in
a finite number of steps
• Normal Kernel (      ) exhibits a smooth trajectory, but 
is slower than Uniform Kernel (      ).

Bhattacharyya Coefficient
Measure the similarity between two probability distributions; It tells us how much overlap there is between
the two distributions, and can help us determine how similar or dissimilar they are

Problem:
Target is 
represented by color 
info only
Spatial info is lost
Solution:
Mask the target with an 
isotropic kernel in the 
spatial domain
f(y) becomes smooth in 
y
f is not smooth
Gradient-based 
optimizations are 
not robust
Large similarity 
variations for 
adjacent locations
