How to Write a Conclusion
Step 1.  SUMMARY OF THE MAIN FINDING
•Briefly recap the main points and results of your study. Focus on the key findings that directly address 
your research questions or hypotheses.
•Avoid introducing new information in the conclusion; it should be a synthesis of what you've already 
presented.
Most existing local transformations for stereo matching are designed heuristically using expert knowledge. Therefore, they 
require a lot of time to investigate and design a suitable feature for specific conditions.

Step 2. RESTATE THE RESEARCH QUESTION/OBJECTIVE
•Remind the reader of the research questions or objectives that guided your study. Highlight how your 
findings contribute to addressing these questions.
In this paper, we investigated deep learning to develop a robust stereo data cost that improves the performance of existing 
stereo matching without requiring much expert knowledge. We hope that this research will provide new insight regarding the 
benefits of deep learning-based unsupervised approaches for stereo matching. The accuracy of a stereo matching algorithm 
depends on how much data can be mined in the training process rather than on designing a feature for specific conditions.

How to Write a Conclusion
Step 3. DISCUSS THE IMPLICATION OF THE FINDINGS 
• Explain the importance and implications of your results. 
•Discuss how your study adds to the existing body of knowledge in the field. Consider the broader implications of your findings 
and their potential impact on future research, practice, or policy.
The proposed LDE stereo method outperforms dominant stereo methods, including SAD, Census, and ANCC. Based on the robust experiments 
in both indoor and outdoor conditions, the proposed LDE stereo method has the following advantages. 
•
LDE is less sensitive to radiometric variations and realistic conditions than the current dominant local pattern methods (LDP or LTrP). 
•
The performances of conventional stereo matching algorithms, such as BP, SGM, and GC are significantly improved by applying LDE as the 
data cost in the SGM and global matching models. 
•
Under normal conditions and conditions with brightness differences, the proposed LDE method offers a better performance than popular 
stereo data costs such as SAD, Census, and ANCC. 
•
The proposed LDE method can be applied to improve the performance of current stereo methods under conditions with brightness 
differences.

How to Write a Conclusion
Step 4. LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
•Acknowledge any limitations in your study. This demonstrates a thoughtful and realistic approach to your research and shows 
that you are aware of the constraints of your work.
•Propose possible avenues for future research. Identify areas that could benefit from further investigation based on the gaps or 
limitations identified in your study.
We also clarify the weakness of the proposed data cost. Currently, parameters ψ and φ of the proposed matching cost are selected by 
performing tests in the large data sets. These parameters should be adaptively tuned based on local region information. 
We plan to resolve this shortcoming in future work. We implemented the local census-based FPGA in [41] to obtain real-time processing and 
good results under realistic conditions. Moreover, the stereo system [41] has been used to develop a successful vehicle detection system 
[53]. Real-time implementation of the SGM-based LDE matching cost in an FPGA system will be considered in the future work to improve the 
performance of the vehicle detection system.

The Local Binary Pattern (LBP) and its variants have been widely investigated in many image
processing and computer vision applications due to their robust ability to capture local image
structures and because of their computational simplicity. The existing LBPs extract local structure
information by establishing a relationship between the central pixel and its adjacent pixels.
However, most local binary patterns miss the relationship among all of the pixels in the local region.
Therefore, this paper proposes a novel model to establish this relationship by introducing a support
local binary pattern (SLBP). The proposed model improves the performance of the existing LBP
methods and results in lower sensitivity to illumination changes and radiometric variations.
Moreover, the proposed model has been successfully investigated in two applications: disparity map
generation and texture classification.
For disparity map generation, the proposed model reduces the root mean square error (RMS) by
23.6% (in Baby1 dataset, Middlebury), and 16.58% (in Aloe dataset, Middlebury) as compared with
the standard LBP under radiometric variation conditions. Moreover, the proposed model reduces the
RMS by 28.11% as compared with the standard LBP under the Gaussian noise condition in the
ESATS
dataset.

Things to Avoid in Abstract
Don't Introduce New Information:
Do not provide detailed information about the research method
Avoid providing citations
Don't Use Abbreviations or Acronyms Without Explanation:
Keep the abstract brief and focused. Avoid including excessive 
details, background information, or data that are not essential to 
understanding the main findings and conclusions of your study.
The abstract should not contain information or results that are not 
presented in the main body of the paper. It's not the place to introduce 
new data, methods, or findings.
If you use abbreviations or acronyms, ensure that you define them in 
the abstract. Readers should be able to understand your abstract 
without referring to the full paper.
Typically, abstracts do not include references. Avoid citing other works 
or including a list of references in the abstract. Save citations for the 
main body of the paper.

Reviewer’s comments
“It is bad that there is no way to reproduce
the result by the audience since there is no
executable or demo program. It is not easy
to detect a lane by "mouth". You need to
provide some ways to generate good
results as mentioned in the paper. The
reader will not cite this work for comparison
for future publications if it is impossible to
reproduce the results”

“Need to provide a way to help the
audience to compare your results with
theirs. It is not possible to reproduce the
exact results within weeks for general
readers. No one can cite your paper since
they cannot compare it easily”

Case Study
“Given that the paper has rather limited technical novelty (also due to the existence of [27]), I would think
the paper has to provide more "new insights", or interesting designs, or convincing new experiments or
stellar results to justify a journal publication. Though the paper claims the "new insights" in the conclusion,
auto encoder is actually applied in a straightforward way independently for each input matching pair. Sect.
E and Fig. 7 are not rigorous or relevant for this particular paper, for instance, where will the part be
detected for such a shallow network with a small receptive field of 9x9? Another sign of the paper being
very experimental and lacking of depth is that when it's realised that adding another hidden layer does not
help by experiments, then it is immediately declared understanding this as a future work”
