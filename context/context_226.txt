Residual Networks (ResNet): A type of CNNs first introduced 
in 2015. Its innovative approach involes using “residual 
blocks”, which allow the network to efficiently train 
extremely deep models by learning residual (difference) 
between the input and desired output.

ResNet Connectivity
In ResNet, the output of a layer is combined 
with the input to create a residual connection 
or shorcut connection.

DataLoader is an 
iterator, so we can get a 
sample (image_path, 
label) and visualize it.

•
train_loader: the dataloader of train set.
•
val_loader: the dataloader of val set.
•
criterion: the pytorch loss function.
•
optimizer: the pytorch learning algorithm.
•
device: ‘cuda’ or ‘cpu’.
•
epochs: number of epochs.
