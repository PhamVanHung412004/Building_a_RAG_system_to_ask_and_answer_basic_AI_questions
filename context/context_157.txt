Review Decision Tree
‚óè
Root Node: The initial node at the beginning of a decision 
tree, where the entire population or dataset starts dividing 
based on various features or conditions.
‚óè
Decision Nodes: Nodes resulting from the splitting of root 
nodes are known as decision nodes. These nodes represent 
intermediate decisions or conditions within the tree.
‚óè
Leaf Nodes: Nodes where further splitting is not possible, 
often indicating the final classification or outcome. Leaf nodes 
are also referred to as terminal nodes.
‚óè
Pruning: The process of removing or cutting down specific 
nodes in a decision tree to prevent overfitting and simplify the 
model.
‚óè
Branch / Sub-Tree: A subsection of the entire decision tree is 
referred to as a branch or sub-tree. It represents a specific 
path of decisions and outcomes within the tree.
‚óè
Parent and Child Node: In a decision tree, a node that is 
divided into sub-nodes is known as a parent node, and the 
sub-nodes emerging from it are referred to as child nodes. 
The parent node represents a decision or condition, while the 
child nodes represent the potential outcomes or further 
decisions based on that condition

Adaboost
Gradient Boost
An additive model where shortcomings of previous 
models are identified by high-weight data points.
An additive model where shortcomings of previous 
models are identified by the gradient.
The trees are usually grown as decision stumps.
The trees are grown to a greater depth usually ranging 
from 8 to 32 terminal nodes.
Each classifier has different weights assigned to the 
final prediction based on its performance.
All classifiers are weighed equally and their predictive 
capacity is restricted with learning rate to increase 
accuracy.
It gives weights to both classifiers and observations 
thus capturing maximum variance within data.
It builds trees on previous classifier‚Äôs residuals thus 
capturing variance in data.
