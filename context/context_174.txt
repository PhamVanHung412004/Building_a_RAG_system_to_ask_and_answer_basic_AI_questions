How Do Reviewers Expect
Comprehensiveness
Reviewers look for evidence that the author has conducted a thorough 
literature review. This includes covering seminal works, recent 
publications, and key research in the field. A comprehensive review 
demonstrates the author's familiarity with existing literature.
Relevance
The related work section should focus on studies directly related to the 
research topic. Reviewers assess whether the cited works are relevant 
to the research question or problem addressed in the paper.
Critical Analysis
Reviewers expect more than just a list of references. They look for a 
critical analysis of the existing literature, highlighting strengths, 
weaknesses, and limitations of prior work. This analysis helps in 
positioning the author's research in the context of what is already 
known.
Identification of Gaps
A good related work section identifies gaps or limitations in existing 
research that the current study aims to address. Reviewers assess 
whether the author convincingly argues for the need for their research 
based on identified 
Integration with the Research 
Question
Reviewers assess how well the related work section aligns with the 
research question or problem statement. The section should build a 
logical bridge between what is already known and the proposed 
research.
Up-to-Date References
The inclusion of recent and up-to-date references is essential. 
Reviewers check to see if the author has considered the most current 
research in the field.

Reviewer Comment: "Several seminal works are missing from your related work section. Please include references to [specific papers] as they 
are critical to the understanding of the background."
Reviewer Comment: "The related work needs more critical analysis. Rather than just summarizing each work, provide insights into how these 
studies contribute or fall short in addressing the research gap."

Reviewer Comment: "The organization of the related work section is confusing. Consider reordering the studies or grouping them by thematic 
relevance to improve clarity for the reader."
Reviewer Comment: "The related work section lacks a clear identification of research gaps. Please discuss the limitations of existing studies 
and how your research fills these gaps."
Reviewer Comment: "The related work appears biased towards a particular perspective. Ensure that you present a balanced view by including 
studies that may have different findings or viewpoints."
Reviewer Comment: "There is some redundancy between the introduction and related work sections. Clarify the distinct purpose of each section 
to avoid repetition."
Reviewer Comment: "The analysis of the related work is quite surface-level. Provide a more in-depth examination of methodologies, results, 
and implications of the cited studies."

BACKGROUND OF RESEARCH TOPICS/QUESTIONS
Stereo vision plays an important role in many applications, such as 3-D tracking [1], 3-D driving
environments [2], 3-D scanning [3], and 2-D and 3-D change detection [4]. Stereo information is
effective for detecting vehicles and estimating distances to vehicles in driving conditions, as described
in a comprehensive report [5]. However, stereo vision-based driving assistance is challenging under
realistic conditions due to difficulties such as occlusion, textureless regions, illumination artifacts, flying
snow, rain flare, rain blur, sun flare, or illumination differences, as described in the Heidelberg
Collaboratory for image processing (HCI) data set [6].

STEP 2
STRENGTH AND WEAKNESS OF EXISTING METHODS
STEREO matching algorithm consists of four main steps: data cost, aggregation cost, optimization, and
post processing; the data cost is the most important step among the four. Many algorithms have been
proposed to produce a robust stereo data cost under various conditions. These include the Census
and Rank transforms [1], adaptive normalized cross correlation (ANCC) [2], guided image filtering
[3], and local density encoding (LDE) [4]. The main objective of those data costs is to extract more
accurate and robust information from the local region. However, expert knowledge is required to
develop those data costs under specific conditions. For example, Census works well when the gray-level
changes monotonically; however, it fails in uniform regions or with larger illumination variations. ANCC
can handle neither multiple illumination conditions nor non-Lambertian reflectance objects. Thus, those
data costs cannot function well under conditions that vary from those for which they were designed.

RESULTS OF YOUR PROPOSED METHOD Vs. SOTA METHODS
• Many stereo methods are based on the assumption that the colors or
intensities of the left and right images have similar values and perform
very
well-under
controlled
conditions
[10]–[15];
however,
their
performances degrade significantly in the presence of photometric or
radiometric variations, including illumination direction, illuminant color,
brightness differences, and image device changes. Fig. 2 shows the
performance of the new method proposed in this paper with two
conventional global and semiglobal stereo methods under rain flare
conditions: semiglobal matching (SGM) [8] and belief propagation (BP)
[10] using the sum of absolute

MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS OF YOUR PROPOSED METHOD
Recently, deep learning performed optimally in various applications, such as natural language processing, texture classification, and
object recognition [5]–[7]. The performance of existing applications has been significantly increased, by 30% or more, through the use
of the deep learning approach. Therefore, this paper investigates a deep learning strategy to improve the performance of existing
stereo matching algorithms. The main contributions of this paper are as follows.
1) This research is the first to apply a deep learning strategy- based unsupervised approach to develop a robust trans- formation
function to compute stereo matching costs (it is different from the work in [8], which used supervised learning to develop a new data
cost function).
2) We investigate how a deep learning strategy can be ap- plied to calculate stereo data costs.
3) The proposed transformation function outperforms existing state-of-the-art data costs using the KITTI benchmark [9] and the
Middlebury [10] and HCI datasets [11].
4) The proposed approach can improve the performance of existing stereo data costs without requiring their structures to be modified.

How Do Reviewers Expect
Clarity of Purpose
Reviewers look for a clear statement of the research problem, 
question, or hypothesis. The introduction should succinctly convey the 
purpose and significance of the study.
Background Information
A good introduction provides sufficient background information to help 
readers understand the context of the research. Reviewers assess 
whether the background is relevant and well-balanced, offering enough 
information without overwhelming the reader.
Literature Review
Reviewers examine the integration of the literature review into the 
introduction. They look for a critical review of existing research, 
demonstrating the author's understanding of the current state of the 
field.
Research Gap Identification
The introduction should identify a gap in the existing literature that the 
current study aims to address. Reviewers assess how well the author 
justifies the need for their research based on identified gaps.
Significance of the Study
Reviewers assess how well the introduction communicates the broader 
significance of the research. It should articulate why the study is 
important and how it contributes to the field.
 
Logical Flow
The introduction should have a logical flow, guiding the reader from 
the general context to the specific research question. Reviewers check 
for coherence and smooth transitions between different components 
of the introduction.

Reviewers’ Comments
Reviewer Comment: "The introduction is somewhat verbose. Consider condensing the background information and focusing on key points to 
enhance clarity and conciseness."
Reviewer Comment: "The research question and objectives are not clearly articulated. Please explicitly state your research aim and the specific 
objectives guiding your study."
Reviewer Comment: "The introduction lacks sufficient contextualization of the research problem. Provide more background information to help 
readers understand the significance of the study."
Reviewer Comment: "Integrate the literature review more seamlessly into the introduction to establish a stronger foundation for your research. 
Connect the existing knowledge to the gap your study aims to address."
Reviewer Comment: "There is some redundancy with the related work section. Ensure that the introduction and related work complement each 
other without repeating information."
