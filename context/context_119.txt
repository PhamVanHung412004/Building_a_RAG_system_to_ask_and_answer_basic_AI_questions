GNN: Review
Even on CNN, an input image can be modeled as a graph. For example, the graph for a 5 × 
5 image. Each node represents a pixel and for the case of a 3 × 3 filter, every node is 
connected to its eight immediate neighbors.

GNN: Review
In particular, when the relationships 
between 
neighboring 
nodes 
are 
irregular and high dimensional, we 
need to define them explicitly in order 
to solve them efficiently. In CNN, we 
work in a Euclidean space. How 
weights are associated with the input 
features (pixels) is well defined.
But this is not the case for a graph. 
For example, the graphs above are 
the same even though it looks 
different spatially.

This leads us to the challenge of how a NN can process a graph directly.
In general, neural 
networks (NNs) takes an 
input x to predict z.

In GCN (Graph Convolutional Network), the input to the NN will be a graph. Also, instead of inferring a single z, 
it infers the value zᵢfor each node i in the graph. And to make predictions for Zᵢ, GCN utilizes both Xᵢand its 
neighboring nodes in the calculation.

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
The general idea of GCN is to apply convolution over a graph. Instead of having a 2-D array as input, 
GCN takes a graph as an input.

GNN: Review
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN)
That comes to the output of the hidden layer to 
be σ(ÂHⁱWⁱ). If we ignore W for a second, for each 
node in a hidden layer, ÂHⁱ sums up features on 
each node with its neighbors.
Diminishing or exploding problem in a NN
In specific, GCN wants Â to be normalized 
to maintain the scale of the output feature 
vectors
One possibility is to multiple Â with D̂⁻¹ where D̂ is the diagonal node degree 
matrix of Â in measuring the degree of each node

GNN: Review
For an undirected graph, the degree of a node is counted as the number of times an edge terminates at that node. So 
a self-loop will count twice. In our example, node 0 has 2 edges connecting to its neighbors plus a self-loop. Its degree 
equals 4 (i.e. 2 + 2). For node 3, its degree equals 5 (3 + 2).

Graph Convolu6onal Networks (GCN)
The diagram summarizes the model discussed 
so far. In this example, it has 3 hidden layers 
and for each hidden layer, it computes its 
output as σ(D̂⁻¹ÂHⁱWⁱ). The equation used to 
compute a hidden layer output from the last 
layer output is called the propagation rule.

Zachary’s karate club 
There is a karate club that has two major stakeholders: the instructor (Mr. Hi) and the administrator. Unfortunately, the 
dispute between them causes it to split into 2 clubs. The original members will need to choose a side and pick which one 
to join. Their decisions will be based on how well they are connected with Mr. Hi or the administrator. This also includes 
how well they are connected to members that are associated with them. The diagram below is the social graph in 
representation connections between members.

ESOL is a small dataset consisting of water solubility data for 1128 compounds. The 
dataset has been used to train models that estimate solubility directly from chemical 
structures (as encoded in SMILES strings). Note that these structures don’t include 
3D coordinates, since solubility is a property of a molecule and not of its particular 
conformers.
How are different molecules dissolving in water?

Vision GNN: Read and Understand
The widely-used convolutional neural network and 
transformer treat the image as a grid or sequence structure, 
which is not flexible to capture irregular and complex 
objects
In this paper, we propose to represent the image as a graph 
structure and introduce a new Vision GNN (ViG) 
architecture to extract graph level feature for visual tasks
