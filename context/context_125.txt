Robust Stereo Matching Various Weather Conditions
2. Introduction 
Stereo matching is a fundamental computer vision task that involves the 
computation of dense disparity maps from stereo image pairs. The goal is to 
establish correspondences between pixels in the left and right images, providing 
depth information crucial for 3D perception. However, the accuracy and reliability 
of stereo matching algorithms are often challenged by various real-world factors 
such as occlusions, varying lighting conditions, and textureless regions.
In response to these challenges, the concept of robust stereo matching has 
emerged as a critical area of research within computer vision. Robust stereo 
matching aims to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of disparity estimation 
under adverse conditions, ensuring the reliability of depth information in a wide 
range of scenarios.

Your brain can easily recognize this is the same object, even though all 
photos are taken from different angles. CNNs do not have this capability.
The paper that uses this approach was able to cut error rate by 45% as
