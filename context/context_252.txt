Neuron: Simple Explanation
Neuron and it’s different components
In 
the 
early 
1940’s 
Warren 
McCulloch, 
a 
neurophysiologist, teamed up with logician Walter Pitts to 
create a model of how brains work. It was a simple linear 
model that produced a positive or negative output, given 
a set of inputs and weights.

Neuron: Simple Explanation
The first application of the neuron replicated a logic gate, where you have one or two binary inputs, and a boolean function that only gets 
activated given the right inputs and weights

It couldn’t learn like

It was only a decade later that Frank Rosenblatt extended this model, and created an algorithm that could learn the weights in order to generate an 
output.

Perceptron: Simple Explanation
Frank Rosenblatt extended neuron model, and created an algorithm that could learn the weights in order to generate an output.
It gets its name from performing the human-like function of perception, seeing and recognizing images.
Perceptrons neuron model (left) and threshold logic (right).

It does! Perceptron uses Stochastic Gradient Descent to 
find!
