PyTorch JIT and TorchScript
With TorchScript, PyTorch aims to create a unified framework from research to production. TorchScript will take your PyTorch modules as input 
and convert them into a production-friendly format
PyTorch supports 2 separate modes to handle research and production environment.
•
First is the Eager mode. It is built for faster prototyping, training, and experimentation.
•
Second is the Script mode. It is focused on the production use case. It has 2 components PyTorch JIT and TorchScript.

Example 1: Number Generation
Simple model that takes N noise vectors as input
and outputs N numbers between 0 and 9
Input: 2
Output: 07
The model will take in a vector with 2 elements
(which is just some arbitrary number I chose) and
output a vector with 10 elements where each
element in the output vector is the probability the
model thinks that number should be chosen

Before working on the app, you can imagine a
normal
model
has
several
problems.
For
example:
A good model is probably very large
A model can take a while to load
Models can take a while to make a prediction

Optimize the model for deployment
To reduce these problems, PyTorch has a very useful feature called TorchScript which optimizes the model for deployment
Now we have an optimized model to put in our app!

Example 3: Object Detection with YOLO
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is one of the fastest and most popular object detection models. YOLOv5 is an open-source implementation of the
latest version of YOLO. This Object Detection with YOLOv5 Android sample app uses the PyTorch scripted YOLOv5 model to detect objects of
the 80 classes trained with the model.

Example 4: Transfer Learning
Train a convolutional neural network for image classification using transfer learning
In practice, very few people train an entire Convolutional Network from scratch (with random initialization), because it is relatively rare to have a 
dataset of sufficient size. Instead, it is common to pretrain a ConvNet on a very large dataset (e.g. ImageNet, which contains 1.2 million images 
with 1000 categories), and then use the ConvNet either as an initialization or a fixed feature extractor for the task of interest.
These two major transfer learning scenarios look as follows:
q Finetuning the ConvNet: Instead of random initialization, we initialize the network with a pretrained network, like the one that is 
trained on imagenet 1000 dataset. Rest of the training looks as usual.
q ConvNet as fixed feature extractor: Here, we will freeze the weights for all of the network except that of the final fully connected 
layer. This last fully connected layer is replaced with a new one with random weights and only this layer is trained.

Example 4: Transfer Learning
Train a convolutional neural network for image classification using transfer learning
The problem we’re going to solve today is to train a model to classify ants and bees. We have 
about 120 training images each for ants and bees. There are 75 validation images for each 
class. Usually, this is a very small dataset to generalize upon, if trained from scratch. Since we 
are using transfer learning, we should be able to generalize reasonably well.
