What is a API?
URL endpoint: Is a URL link that represents the resources we want to 
access. Resources can be text, images, documents or any data entry. 
HTTP verb: Tells the server what we want to do with the URL endpoint resource. For example, a POST request means we want to create a 
new survey template and a GET request means we want to view an existing survey template.
Body message: Is an optional custom payload which contains a message with the properties and values we want to use to create or 
update a given resource.
An Application Programming Interface (API) is a way for two 
computers to talk to each other over the web.
