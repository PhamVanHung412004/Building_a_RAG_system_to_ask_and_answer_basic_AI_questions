YOLO – V1
You Only Look Once
Unified, Real-Time Object Detection
(1) A single neural network for 
localization and for classification
(2) Need to inference only once
(3) Looks at the entire image each 
time leading to less false positives

Total Loss Function
1. penalize bad localization of center of cells
2. penalize the bounding box with inaccurate height and
width. The square root is present so that errors in small
bounding boxes are more penalizing than errors in big
bounding boxes.
3. make confidence score equal to the IoU between the
object and the prediction when there is one object
4. make confidence score close to 0 when there are no
object in the cell
5. a simple classification loss (not explained in the article)
