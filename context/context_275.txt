2. Problem identification
• Unconditional reflex
• Experiment 
• Artifical neural network 
contradiction
• What is algorithsm and its 
origin? 
• Instructions for forming 
connections in the brain in an 
organized manner.
• Products derived from DNA 
directly affect the electrical 
current in neurons.
• DNA acts as a database and 
information is extracted by 
interactions between DNA and 
proteins – microbial memory.
Potential applications 
• Artificial intelligence
• Data storage
• Robotics 
• Quantum
•
Brain – computer interface 
Reverse 
engineering
• Step 1: Identify the principal 
components and their 
fundamental functions.
• Step 2: Study the arrangement 
between fundamental functions.
• Step 3: Simulation, digital twin 
and validate the hypothesis with 
experiments.

APLICATION OF AI 
BOOLEAN NETWORK INFERENCE BY GENETICS ALGORITHM
• Protein structure prediction.
• Protein–protein interactions.
• Methylation sites, DNA-protein 
binding sites.
Experimental:
X-ray crystallography.
Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.
Computational:
Explicit sequence-to-structure maps: physics-
based molecules, ab initio.
Using co-evolution information: comparative, 
deep learning + assembly method.
End to end: RNN, CNN, LSTM, transformer 
architects.

4. EEG Signal 
processing
• Paresthesia phenomenon
• Electrical synapses
• Common mapping functions
• FFT: Converts signals from the time 
domain to the frequency domain, filtering 
out signals outside the brain's frequency 
range.
• BSS: separate a set of source signals from 
a set of mixed signals without prior 
information about the source signals or 
the mixing process. The goal is to recover 
the original source signals from their 
observed mixtures.
Step 1: Load EEG data from the buffer at every 1 second
1 −𝑠𝑏𝑢𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟
Step 2: Use a 2-s window and 50% overlap between two consecutive
Windows to extract features
Step 3: Predict emotional states based on three consecutive segmented 
And overlapping windows

•
Input Gate:
Decides which information from the input should be stored in 
the memory cell.
•
Forget Gate:
Decides which information stored in the memory cell should 
be discarded or kept.
•
Cell State: 
Represents the long-term memory and is modified by the 
input gate and forget gate.
•
Output Gate:
Decides what information from the memory cell should be 
output as the final prediction.
