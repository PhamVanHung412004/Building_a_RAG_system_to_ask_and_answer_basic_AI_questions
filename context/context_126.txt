Interesting point:  (1) Rich content within the local window. (2) Well-define representation for mathing/comparing with other points. (3) 
Well-define position in the image. (4) Should be invariant to image rotation and scaling. (5) Should be insenitve to lighting changes

Are Blob Interesting?
Blob has fixed position and definite size: location, 
size, and orientation
A Blob, in a sense, is anything that is considered a
large object or anything bright in a dark background,
in images, we can generalize it as a group of pixel
values that forms a somewhat colony or a large
object that is distinguishable from its background.

From Edges to Blobs
•We want to find the characteristic scale of the blob by convolving it with Laplacians at several scales and looking for the maximum 
response 
•However, Laplacian response decays as scale increases 
Why does this happen?

Scale normalization
The response of a derivative of Gaussian filter to a perfect step edge decreases as σ increases 
To keep response the same (scale-invariant), must multiply 
Gaussian derivative by σ 
Laplacian is the second Gaussian derivative, so it must be 
multiplied by σ2

Scale-space extrema detection
However, just doing this does not guarantee that SIFT is scale-invariant because the 
algorithm currently only looks at the image in one fixed scale. In order to observe 
the image from many different scales, SIFT integrates the idea of Gaussian 
Pyramid into this.
Gaussian pyramid is a multi-scale representation of an image
containing a properly re-sized(re-scaled) version of the original image
by sampling with Gaussian blurring in order to avoid the aliasing issue

Scale-space extrema detection
Local extrema detection
Local extrema (either maxima or minima) are detected by comparing a pixel (red circle) to its 26 neighbors (green) in 3×3 window at the current and
adjacent (above and below) scales. More specifically, only a point DoG(x, y, σ) is selected if it is larger or smaller than all of its neighbors. The list of
detected extremum (x, y, σ) is the keypoint candidates which will be processed later on in SIFT algorithm.
