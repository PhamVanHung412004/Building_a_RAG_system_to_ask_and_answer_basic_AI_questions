Allowances:
-
You are encouraged to utilize pre-trained  Large Language Models (LLMs) that are freely available 
online, such as Bloom, Llama, and others. However, it is essential to ensure that the pre-trained  models 
you use are both free and publicly accessible on the internet. If you decide to train your own pre-trained  
models, you must provide us with the original textual data and the complete script outlining the entire 
process of creating these models.
-
We have set a limit on the size of pre-trained  models to 14 billion parameters, which allows you to make 
use of some open-source pre-trained  models.
Restrictions:
-
Using APIs that call any external services (e.g. Open AI, Google, ...) during training and inference.
-
Training & inference with Internet access.

Additional finetuning data:
-
You have the option to leverage the capabilities of other large language models to enhance your models or 
collect data from the internet for fine-tuning. However, it is mandatory to declare and submit all data 
sources and the data cleaning process to ensure that the results can be replicated.
Constraints:
-
The inference time for each test case must not exceed 30 seconds on a single A30 or RTX 3090 GPU.
