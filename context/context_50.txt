Output
The forward diffusion method progressively adds Gaussian noise to the input picture x0, for a total of T steps. The technique will generate a 
series of noisy picture samples x1,..., x T.
When T is large, the resultant image will be fully noisy, as if it were sampled from an isotropic Gaussian distribution.

Forward Diffusion Process: Review
Instead of creating an algorithm to
add noise to the picture repeatedly,
we may use a closed-form formula to
directly sample a noisy image at a
specified time step t.

Reverse Diffusion Process
Unlike the forward process, we cannot use
q(xₜ₋₁|xₜ) to reverse the noise since it is
intractable (uncomputable).
Train
a
neural
network
pθ(xₜ₋₁|xₜ)
to
approximate
q(xₜ₋₁|xₜ).
The
approximation
pθ(xₜ₋₁|xₜ) follows a normal distribution and its
mean and variance are set as follows:

Loss Function
Define a loss as a Negative Log-Likelihood :
Instead of optimizing the intractable loss function itself, we can optimize the Variational Lower Bound.
This term compares the target denoising step q and the approximated denoising step pθ.

Loss Function
To approximate the target denoising step q, we only need to
approximate its mean using a neural network. So we set the
approximated mean μθ to be in the same form as the target
mean μ̃ₜ (with a learnable neural network εθ):

Loss Function
The comparison between the target mean and the approximated mean can be done using a mean squared error (MSE):
Experimentally, better results can be achieved by ignoring the weighting term and simply comparing the target and predicted noises with MSE.
So, it turns out that to approximate the desired denoising step q, we just need to approximate the noise εₜ using a neural network εθ.

Reverse Diffusion Output Visualization
Each time we predict the noise using a neural network, we 
subtract part of it and move to the next step. That is how 
the diffusion process works. But what will happen if we 
just subtract all the noise?

You can use fewer timesteps in your schedule when 
doing the inference after the model is trained.

The classic models use linear convolutional layers and
the layers are followed by an activation function to scan
the input, while the NiN uses multilayer perceptron
convolutional layers, at which each layer includes a
micro-network.

Summary
1
• The Diffusion model is divided into two parts: forward 
diffusion and reverse diffusion. 
2
• The forward diffusion can be done using the closed-form 
formula.
3
• The backward diffusion can be done using a trained neural 
network. 
4
• To approximate the desired denoising step q, we just need to 
approximate the noise εₜ using a neural network εθ. 
• Training on the simplified loss function yields better sample 
quality.
