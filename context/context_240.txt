Object Detection: A computer vision task that involves 
indentifying and locating objects of interest in an image or 
video.

Introduction
v Image Classification vs Object Detection
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
Unlike image classification, where the goal is to assign a label to an entire image, object detection aims to identify 
multiple objects and provide bounding boxes around them, specifying where each of object is in the image.

Two-stage Object Detection: A combination of Object Localization and Object Classification.

Introduction
v Object Localization
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
Object Localization: A computer vision task that seeks to 
pinpoint the location of a specific object in an image. The 
primary output for object localization is usually a bounding 
box that encompasses the objects of interest.

Example: Multiple bounding boxes are presented to identify the position of two dogs. Green seems more 
accurate than Blue.

Introduction
v Object Localization: Bounding box
AI VIETNAM

Bouding box
Bounding box: A rectangular box used to describe the 
location of an object within an image. Bounding box is 
often represented as a tuple of (x_center, y_center, width, 
height) or (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax).

AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course

Object Classification (Image Classification): A computer 
vision task that involes assigning a predefined category or 
label to an image. In this project, we will use SVM to build 
an image classifier.

AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
Confidence Score: A value represents how ‘confident’ the model is 
to assign a class to the corresponding object. Confidence Score is 
often taken from the output of Object Classifier.

Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG): A feature 
descriptor used primarily in object detection. It was

was applied to pedestrian detection and achieved 
significant improvements over then-existing algorithms.

Sliding Window: A technique used in computer 
vision and signal processing where a fixed-size 
“window” (or a sub-rectangle) is moved across an 
image (or a signal) to analyze a local region at a time.
Example: Using sliding window to find a 
cup within an image.
