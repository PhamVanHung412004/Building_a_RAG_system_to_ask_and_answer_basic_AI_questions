(TA Session)
Unspervised Learning is 
used to train machines 
using labeled data.
Supervised Learning uses 
unlabeled data to train 
machines.
Reinforcement Learning 
uses an agent and an 
environment to produce 
actions and rewards.

•
Reinforcement learning is a framework for solving control tasks (also called decision problems) 
•
By building agents that learn from the environment by interacting with it through trial and error. 
•
And receiving rewards (positive or negative) as unique feedback.
Learning from 
interactions with the 
environment comes 
from our natural 
experiences.

The Policy π is the brain of our Agent, it’s the function that tells us what action to take given the 
state we are in. So it defines the agent’s behavior at a given time.
This Policy is the function we want to learn, our goal is to find the optimal policy π*, the policy that 
maximizes expected return when the agent acts according to it. We find this π* through training.

❖ How to find optimal policy 𝝅∗

Directly, by teaching the agent to learn which 
action to take, given the current state.
Policy-Based Methods
Value-Based Methods
Indirectly, teach the agent to learn which state is 
more valuable and then take the action that leads 
to the more valuable states

Reinforcement Learning
❖ Value-based methods
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
We learn a value function that maps a state to the expected 
value of being at that state.
𝑉𝜋𝑠: value of a state is the expected discounted return the agent can 
get if it starts in that state, and then acts according to our policy.

•
Monte Carlo is a strategy to train our value function function. 
•
It use experience to solve the RL problem.
•
Monte Carlo uses an entire episode of experience before learning.
•
So it requires a complete episode of interaction before updating our value function.

Q-learning is a value-based methods.
Q-learning is a simple Reinforcemen Learning algorithm
Q-learning uses a TD approach to train its action-value 
function. 
Q-Learning is the algorithm we use to train our Q-function, an 
action-value function that determines the value of being at a 
particular state and taking a specific action at that state.

Q-Learning
❖ Getting Started
AI VIETNAM

•
The Q-function uses a Q-table that has the value of each state-action pair. 
•
Given a state and action, our Q-function will search inside its Q-table to output the value.
•
Q(s, a) is the the value by starting from s and take action a.

•
You’re a mouse in this tiny maze. You always start at the same starting point.
•
The goal is to eat the big pile of cheese at the bottom right-hand corner and avoid the poison. After all, who doesn’t 
like cheese?
•
The episode ends if we eat the poison, eat the big pile of cheese, or if we take more than five steps.
•
The learning rate is 0.1
•
The discount rate (gamma) is 0.99
•
+0: Going to a state with no cheese in it.
•
+1: Going to a state with a small cheese in it.
•
+10: Going to the state with the big pile of cheese.
•
-10: Going to the state with the poison and thus dying.
•
+0 If we take more than five steps.
