❖ What is VQA?
AI VIETNAM
All-in-One Course
(TA Session)
Visual Question Answering (VQA): A task in Machine 
Learning that aims to answer a question related to a 
given image. This is a very challenging problem since 
it requires a model to appropriately extract features 
from both image and text for prediction.
