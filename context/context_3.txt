The key aspect in face recognition is
detecting relevant features in human face
like eyes, eyebrows, nose, lips. So how do we
detect these features in real time/in an
image ?

Methods for Face Detection
Knowledge Based
•Rule based (Ex: X must have eyes, x must have a nose)
•Too many rules and variables with this method
Feature Based
Locate and extract structural features in the face
Find a differential between facial and non facial regions in an image
Appearance Based
Learn the characteristics of a face. Example: CNN’s
Accuracy depends on training data (which can be scarce)
Template
Using predefined templates for edge detection. Quick and easy
A trade off for speed over accuracy

Kauai, HI, USA, 2001, pp. I-I, doi: 10.1109/CVPR.2001.990517.
Viola-Jones uses 24*24 as base window size and calculates the above features all over the image shifting by 1 PX (Template + Feature).
There are over 160,000 possible feature combinations that can fit into a 24x24 pixel image, and over 250,000 for a 28x28 image

Intergral Image
•The value of the integral image at point 1 is the sum of the pixels in rectangle A
•The value at point 2 is A + B
•The value at point 3 is A + C
•The value at point 4 is A + B + C + D.
•Therefore, the sum of pixels in region D can simply be computed as : 4+1−(2+3).

Haar Features for Multiple Scales
Compute Haar Features at different scales to detect faces of 
different sizes
As stated previously there can be approximately 160,000 +
feature values within a detector at 24*24 base resolution
which need to be calculated. But it is to be understood that
only a few set of features will be useful among all these
features to identify a face.
Can we create a good classifier using just a small subset of all possible
features?
Feature detecting a vertical edge is useful detecting a nose but 
irrelevant detecting a lip.

The Cascade Classifier
In an image, most of the image is a non-face region
The key idea is to reject sub-windows that do not contain faces
while identifying regions that do. Since the task is to identify
properly the face, we want to minimize the false negative rate, i.e
the sub-windows that contain a face and have not been identified as
such.
A series of classifiers are applied to every sub-window. These
classifiers are simple decision trees :
•if the first classifier is positive, we move on to the second
•if the second classifier is positive, we move on to the third.
•Any negative result at some point leads to a rejection of the
sub-window as potentially containing a face
