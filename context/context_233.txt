Image Gradient
An image gradient is defined as a directional change in image intensity
Vertical change
Horizontal change
The gradient magnitude is used to measure how strong the change in image intensity is
The gradient orientation is used to determine in which direction the change in intensity is pointing

•
Every time you find yourself standing on a black pixel, turn left
•
Every time you find yourself standing on a white pixel, turn right,
until you encounter the start pixel again.
•
The black pixels you walked over will be the contour of the pattern.

Contour Tracing: Moore-Neighbor
Moore neighborhood
8-neighbors or indirect neighbors
Every time you hit a black pixel, P, backtrack i.e. go back to the white pixel you were previously standing on, then,
go around pixel P in a clockwise direction, visiting each pixel in its Moore neighborhood, until you hit a black pixel.
The algorithm terminates when the start pixel is visited for a second time.
The black pixels you walked over will be the
contour of the pattern.

Contour Tracing: Radial Sweep
Moore neighborhood
8-neighbors or indirect neighbors
Every time you locate a new boundary pixel, make it your current pixel, P, and draw an imaginary line segment joining P to
the previous boundary pixel. Then, rotate the segment about P in a clockwise direction until it hits a black pixel in P's Moore
neighborhood. Rotating the segment is identical to checking each pixel in the Moore neighborhood of P.

Background Substraction
Background subtraction is a widely used approach to detect moving objects in a sequence of frames from static cameras
Why do we need to use 
Background Subtraction?
Given an image (mostly likely to be a video frame), we want to identify the foreground objects in that image!

Simple Approach
1. Estimate the background for time t. 
2. Subtract the estimated background from the input frame. 
3. Apply a threshold T to the absolute difference to get the foreground mask.

how can we estimate the background?

Time t + 1
Depending on the object structure, speed, frame rate 
and global threshold, this approach may or may not 
be useful

Advantages: 
– Extremely easy to implement and use! 
– All pretty fast. 
– Corresponding background models are not constant, they change over 
time
Disadvantages: 
– Accuracy of frame differencing depends on object speed and frame rate! 
– Mean and median background models have relatively high memory 
requirements.
– There is one global threshold, Th, for all pixels in the image
